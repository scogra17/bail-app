# About

This web-based app was inspired by shared, non-logged-in scheduling apps such as LettuceMeet, Doodle and Calendly, but meant for the opposite purpose: to cancel scheduled events if none of the attendees are still interested in going.

The basic premise is to allow an “organizer” to generate a dedicated page for an event or plan. The page is shareable through a unique url and enables non-organizers to sign up as attendees. The attendees (including the organizer) can anonymously “bail”, indicating that they’re no longer interested in attending. If all of the attendees bail, everyone is notified that the event is cancelled.
